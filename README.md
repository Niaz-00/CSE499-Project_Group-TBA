<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>We have reached a point of technological advancement where computers are integrated in almost
every corner of our lives. With that, the demand of talented individuals who are adept in the
world of computer programming is also increasing. That is why, most countries in the world are
creating an education system in such way that kids will get interested in programming at an early
age. But explaining the concept of programming to the young minds is a bit tricky. We can’t
teach them the concept the way it is done to the adults. That is where the visual block
programming comes into picture. Most kids are naturally drawn to pictures and animations. That
is why we are seeing the integration of these things even in our traditional teaching methods.
Block based programming languages are created in such a way that the user won’t have to learn
the complex code behind the blocks and will be able to play with the blocks and create different
animations and moving objects. This became the perfect tool to introduce programming to kids.
With this foundation, various online platforms were created with where block-based
programming was implemented to attract the children. Scratch is the most prominent of them all
as it is very popular among many English-speaking countries. But there is no such platform
available in Bangla language. A platform like this could attract many Bangladeshi kids into the
wonderful world of computer programming. With that goal in mind, we are creating a platform
where kids could play with blocks that have Bangla titles and get interested in programming.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1:</strong></p>

<p>1.1 Introduction</p>

<p>Computer programming has become one of the most important profession of our modern world as
were integrating computers almost everywhere nowadays. Talented programmers are the future of
our world who will solve complex problems and further the development of the science behind
programming. That is why it is important that we introduce programming to the children at an
early age. Kids have a wonderful knack for problem solving and if we can explain the workings
of programming, that will surely make them interested. But explaining programming to kids is
easier said than done. Traditional programming teaching methods would not work as that would
be very complicated for them. That is where the block-based programming language comes in.
Children at an early age are really interested in visual learning. That is why it is thought that
construction-based coding activities will be able to grab their attention. Various studies have
already been conducted on this topic and it is understood that most children managed to adopt
deliberative thinking and was able to understand and imitate mechanical thinking while coding in
a block-based environment like scratch (Papavlasopoulou, Giannakos and Jaccheri 2019). Blockbased programming platforms like scratch can easily grab the attention of the children with their
visually appealing block systems and animations. Kids can master the foundational coding
concepts while playing with these blocks (Strawhacker and Bers 2018).
Platforms like Scratch are surely popular but they are limited to English-speaking countries. Even
though Scratch has some other languages like Spanish, French etc., there is nothing like this in our
native Bangla language.

1.2 Motivation

<p>The goal of our project is to create such a platform like Scratch where children from all over
Bangladesh can learn the basics of programming in their native language. As things stands right
now, most kids in our country are unaware of basic programming concepts. Without a proper and
easy to use platform, we cannot reach them. As a result, most programmers in our country starts
their programming experience later than those from other countries.
We have already seen the usefulness of block-based programming and how they can affect children
from the success of Scratch and Scratch Jr. The goal of our project is to use the same concept but
instead of the default blocks, we are going to use blocks that can be easy to understand for the
Bangladeshi children. We are hoping to create an environment such that kids from our country can
relate to them and learn the basic concepts of programming by playing with them.
	</p>
	
<p><strong>Chapter 2: Background & Significance</strong></p>

When we look at other works that are done in this field, we will see that most of them are done for
a generalized term of kids. Our study or project focuses on Bangladeshi children. But no such work
of significance can be referred on that field. So, we are going to work with these generalized studies
which are applicable for all.
A study by Amanda Strawhacker and Marina Umaschi suggests that block-based programming
can certainly make the kids understand the concept of programming but their level of
understanding and the level of problem solving skills are varied in different age groups
(Strawhacker and Bers 2018). They argued that different teaching methods for different age groups
like kids, pre-teen, and teenagers could improve the learning capabilities of children (Strawhacker
and Bers 2018). This concept was also used by Scratch as they launched ‘ScratchEd’ and
‘ScratchJr’ focusing on two different age groups among kids. Our platform could also use a little
diversification but we don’t see that happening right away. This could be something that can be
implemented in future but right now we are focusing on just one platform.
Another study by Sofia Papavlasopoulou, Michail Giannakos and Letzia Jaccheri suggests that
children learns the concept of programming very easily with block-based programming but
keeping them interested is a bit tricky (Papavlasopoulou, Giannakos and Jaccheri 2019). Their
study suggested that if the platform can offer things like new games and changing animations then
kids are more likely to stick to programming without losing their interest (Papavlasopoulou,
Giannakos and Jaccheri 2019). Platforms like Scratch and ScratchJr already has features like these
where you can create small games and share among friends. This is something that can be easily
integrated in our project too.
Thamizh Selvan on the other hand went on a different route with his study. He looked at different
instances of kids learning programming and tried to understand what format of teaching can
guarantee a more complex understanding of programming while also making it fun (Selvan 2020).
His study found that the usability of the platform greatly influences the attention of the kids. He
suggested that animations and sound are a great way to keep them interested (Selvan 2020). Hw
also found that kids find joy by sharing their work and watching other children’s work. Community
sharing is certainly something that we are hoping to achieve.
All these studies focus on the kids and many technical aspects which makes them interested in
programming. We are certainly hoping to integrate some of these technical aspects which would
improve our platform’s usability. We were hoping to find studies focused on how breaking
language barrier can help with programming study but we could not find such studies.


<p><strong>Chapter 3: Method and Design</strong></p>
The design of our platform has three distinct phases or areas. All actions on the platform are done
through these areas and different aspects of these areas are all interconnected as shown in the block
diagram. The major areas are,
• User Interface: This will deal with creating new user, log in etc. This is the initial stage of
the platform. This will be the control stage where the user will decide what to do.
• Project Manager: This is the area where user will be able to add, create or modify projects.
Publishing a completed project is also an option here. This area has a sub area where users
can explore other projects made by other users.
• Compiler: This is the heart of the platform as this is where the blocks will be used. This
will have some subsection for animation, sound, characters etc. The design of the compiler
will follow the design of Scratch as we are going to use Scratch 3.0 library for this. But the
overall environment will be done in such a way that kids from Bangladesh can relate to it.
It is needless to say that all of the data of all three stages of the platform will be handled through a
database.
